# ExpandedChestUI
This mod replaces the default Core Keeper Chest UI for a more expansive UI that allows for scrolling. **THIS MOD DOES NOTHING ON IT'S OWN**, but is rather to help Modders more easily create larger chests.

# Usage
For those that wish to use this mod to create thier own chests. Simply add the following code to your dependencies in your manifest.json file.
```json
"ck.modding.expanded-chest-ui": "https://github.com/Minepatcher/ExpandedChestUI.git?path=/Assets/ExpandedChestUI#main"
```
Then, add Expanded Chest UI to your Mod's Assembly Definition References in the .asmdef file.

Everything else for creating your chest is the same as usual, but now you are allowed up to a 15x9 sized chest in the Inventory Authoring of your Chest Enitity Prefab.
